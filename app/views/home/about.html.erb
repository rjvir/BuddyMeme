      <p>Coming into Michigan without ever having seen a program before in his life, David thought it was all about the 0s and 1s. Regardless of what he thought before, after taking his first CS class, he has fallen in love with the hacker lifestyle. Currently picking up html, php, javascript, python, ruby, java, and C++ all at the same time, David aims to one day follow Chris or Raj in their dedicated vocations. </p>
